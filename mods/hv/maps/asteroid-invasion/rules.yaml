		Briefing: You was taken into a Synapol mission, taking you to a Yuruki asteroid colony, which extracts pure iron and coal. Other mercenaries are waiting for you, to command them. Settle a basement, and build a few mining towers and destroy the target Yuruki colony, and then the military basement. Synapol forces were able to take down the Yuruki communication links for 3 minutes. Make sure to not get discovered by the scout units. You will be able to produce unique units during the mission.
