	MissionData:
		Briefing: You were taken on a Synapol mission to a Yuruki asteroid colony, which extracts pure iron and coal. Other mercenaries are waiting for you, to command them. Establish a base, build a few mining towers and destroy the target Yuruki colony as well as the military basement. Synapol forces were able to take down the Yuruki communication links for 3 minutes. Make sure to not get discovered by the scout units. You will be able to produce unique units from the trade platform during the mission, and three airborne reinforcement pads.
