    Greetings commander! A magma breach in Fillum's desert ice lands has been found by explorers 3 days ago. The breach's magma contains many rich materials, and a humongous gold vein has been found around it. The Synapol Corportions have headed there 19 hours ago, and established a basement. Claim this magma breach Yuruki by any way.
      P.S. Be aware that as soon as the Synapol forces will detect you, they will send waves of reinforcement.
