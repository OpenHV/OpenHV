briefing-infiltration-commando =
    A Synapol mining colony is being threatened by a neraby continental airstrike Yuruki outpost. The basement and its surroundings are extremely well protected by automated defenses, and ground, naval and air patrols. The outpost is split in different parts, which are alimented by many different power plant outposts.
        Find the base's communication quarters in the northeastern continent and capture their radar dome to stop the airstrike waves. You must save the colony's buildings from incoming airstrike waves. During your mission, target the Yuruki power plant outposts to delay the airstrikes and power outage their automatic defense systems.
        Alternatively, you can disembark into the continent throughout naval or air transports, and destroy the 4 basements in the headquarters' center, near the Yuruki mothership.

    Nuke Launch Commands and Drop Pods Power are disabled during this mission. Howitzers will have a higher charge rate during this mission.
