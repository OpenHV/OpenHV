		Description: This base of operations is able to summon new buildings as well as utility vehicles such as miners or builders. New buildings are only allowed within a base radius. You can also spawn buildings into an allied base radius. To extend the build radius you need to train builders which can deploy into outposts. Protect the base building at all costs. If your base ever gets destroyed, select an outpost and request a new main base for a possible comeback.

Another important feature is that it is the only building that can build another base, but only in the event of the initial main base getting destroyed.

	Encyclopedia:
		Description: Generators power the base. Loss of power effects buildings individually. Without power the radar shows no minimap, production is slowed down, support power charging is paused, base defense system stop operating.\n\nTo restore power you can build more generators or as a short term action disable certain buildings by clicking the zap button and selected buildings to power down. With power lines cut the actions are more drastic: buildings will be unable to produce or contribute to the tech tree also canceling current production queues if they are effected.\n\nAlways plan ahead so you don't accidentally power down your base slowing down your progress. On the other hand it is a vital strategy to destroy enemy power plants to distract the enemy into power micromanagement, losen defenses temporarily and to put enemy on hold.

Alternatively select the repair icon on the top right of the command interface and click a damaged vehicle which will then automatically head to the nearest trade platform for repairs. As a tech building the trade platform opens up the tank path. It also serves as an additional vehicle production queue by allowing orders from outside. These vary in price and are more expensive than local production.

		Description: Storage buildings are the center of mining operations. Upon fabrication it spawns a miner that can be sent to a resource deposit and it also allows the construction of additional miners in the factory. Once a storage and a mining tower exists, tankers will automatically deliver resources from mining operations into the storage building where the compensation takes place. With no storage building to drop off available all mining operations will halt.
