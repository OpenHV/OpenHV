With power lines cut the actions are more drastic: buildings will be unable to produce or contribute to the tech tree also canceling current production queues if they are effected.

    Always plan ahead so you don't accidentally power down your base slowing down your progress. On the other hand it is a vital strategy to destroy enemy power plants to distract the enemy into power micromanagement, losen defenses temporarily and to put enemy on hold.
