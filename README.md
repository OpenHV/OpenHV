A mod for [OpenRA](http://www.openra.net) based on the [Hard Vacuum](https://lostgarden.home.blog/2005/03/27/game-post-mortem-hard-vacuum/) design by Daniel Cook. It aims to be an open content game with no exceptions.

# Getting Started

To launch the project from the development environment you must first compile the project by running `make.cmd` (Windows), or opening a terminal in the SDK directory and running `make` (Linux / macOS). You can then run `launch-game.cmd` (Windows) or `launch-game.sh` (Linux / macOS) to run the game. More details on [building](https://github.com/OpenHV/OpenHV/wiki/Build) the game are available at the wiki.
