# Getting Started

To launch the project from the development environment you must first compile the project by running `make.cmd` (Windows), or opening a terminal in the SDK directory and running `make` (Linux / macOS).  You can then run `launch-game.cmd` (Windows) or `launch-game.sh` (Linux / macOS) to run the game.
